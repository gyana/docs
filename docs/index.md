Gyana is a fully customisable web-based tool for business intelligence, written in Django.

Why Gyana? In our experience, traditional BI tools lack the flexibility most businesses need, but building a modern data stack is often overkill.

Gyana solves this in two ways:

1. A set of no-code abstractions that provide close to the flexibility of code solutions (but without associated headaches)
2. An extensible, open source codebase where it's easy to add custom business logic (think: formulas, nodes or entire features) in idiomatic Django

Using Gyana, you can deliver a data analytics experience tailored to your needs of your business, stakeholders or clients, without wasting time in repetitive coding tasks.

Watch our 3 minute intro to see how to use Gyana:
