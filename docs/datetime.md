# Datetime reference

How to convert text to date & time with our functions.

Parsing and formatting date & time is a common part of data preparation. This guide will show you how use the Gyana functions `parse_date`, `parse_time`, `parse_datetime` and `format_datetime`.

## Parsing

If you have date & time information stored in a text column, you'll need to use a **parsing** function to extract it.

ðŸ’¡ The column type is displayed by an icon in the header. You can hover over it to view the full type name.

You'll need to tell the parser how to parse the text with a format string. Here are a few examples:

    parse_date('2022-03-22', '%Y-%m-%d')parse_time('20:10:03', '%T')parse_datetime('Tuesday 22 March 2022 at 09:30', '%A %e %B %G at %R')

## Formatting

Formatting is the opposite of parsing - you have a date & time column, and you'd like to display a text representation of it.

Just as with parsing, you'll need to tell the formatter how to format the text with a format string. Here are a few examples:

    format_datetime(datetime_col, '%Y-%m-%d') # e.g. 2022-03-22format_datetime(datetime_col, '%T') # e.g. 20:10:03format_datetime(datetime_col, '%A %e %B %G at %R') # e.g. Tuesday 22 March 2022 at 09:30 

## Format string reference

You can build your format string with the reference below. **Any issues?** Reach out to support.
