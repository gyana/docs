Before you ask, Gyana is a Sanskrit word for “knowledge”, and not the name of South American country 🤣 (yes, we get this question a lot!).

**If you’re anything like us, you have lots of questions and you want to answer them with data.**

You’ve tried dashboard tools, but they lack flexibility and you have to pay for expensive add-ons. **We built Gyana as an affordable, all in one alternative.** We want anyone to use data in their workflow, while supporting all the power features you’d expect.

Whether you work with multiple clients or simply want to make sense of your own data, you work too hard to waste valuable time and money on limited data tools. Reliable data analytics is the foundation for you to deliver your real value and delight your customers.
