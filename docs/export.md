How to export your data in Gyana to a csv file.

Exporting to a CSV file is a handy way for exporting your data to work with it elsewhere.

## ðŸ“¤ Export to CSV

You can export to CSV at any point in the workflow by using the feature at that particular node.

ðŸ’¡ You can download the raw data from your integration by using the exporting to CSV feature from your first "Get Data" node.

1. Click on the "edit" button at the node you want to export from
2.  In the pop-up window, click on the "download" icon
3. You will receive a pop-up that acknowledges your request
4. You will receive an email with the link to download your CSV export

Click on the "Download your CSV export now" link to download your CSV file.

ðŸ’¡ The email with the download link will be sent to the email address you have registered with for your Gyana 2.0 account.

ðŸ’¡ The link to download your CSV export will only be valid for 7 days.

## ðŸ”® What does the future hold?

Exporting to other file formats is certainly something we can build - we just need to know what you need!
