# Collaboration

How to collaborate and organise work in Gyana.

When youâ€™re ready to start a project in Gyana, one of the first things you want to do is invite users to help on internal workflows or work on client projects. Itâ€™s important to know the distinction of teams, projects and user roles.

## ðŸ™Œ Teams

A team is a single workspace where you manage multiple projects and clients. For most users, this will be your organisation. Think of teams like Workspaces/Teams in products like Figma, Notion, Pitch or Slack.

Each team is associated with a separate billing account. When you create a new team (either as part of signup, or within the app), you'll start on the free plan by default.

ðŸ’¡ If you have multiple clients, we still recommend that you have a single team, and use separate projects for each client. You can use invite-only projects to restrict access to only certain members in the team.

You can invite unlimited collaborators to your team. The two user roles in Gyana are **Admins** and **Members**. Everyone in the team has **full access** to all your projects, but only Admins have permissions to manage members, billing and team settings.

##Â ðŸ—‚ Projects

A project gathers your data analytics to solve and share the results of a common set of problems. Projects are where all your data analytics work will happen - integrations, workflows and dashboards.

ðŸ’¡ Any data sources you integrate with a project are only available in that project.

You can create unlimited projects in each team available on all plans. You can start from scratch, or if you've built a project that you want to re-use (e.g. for a different client), just click "**duplicate**".
